<p>Hey, welcome to the first coding challenge of your interview process, you'll be presented with a set of steps to accomplish in order to get yourself graded on </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fullstack JavaScript using the MEAN stack</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a id="the-prereqs" class="anchor" href="#the-prereqs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Prereqs</h2>

<p>This challenge assumes your knowledge or skills to leverage on the following topics,</p>

<ul>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript (or plain JavaScript)</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Mongoose (or another nodejs based ORM for mongodb)</li>
<li>RESTful APIs, webservices</li>
<li>A client side MV* framwork or library (Angular1, Angular2, React(not an mvc, tho) )</li>
<li>Code quality and testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="the-rules" class="anchor" href="#the-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The rules</h2>

<p>This challenge is not set by any hard rule regarding time or style, although both will play key factors on your assessment, yet, here are some rules because... rules</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to fork this project and work on your copy of the code for this to work</li>
<li>You must create a commit per step of the challenge finished, wether you want to push it or not is up to you</li>
<li>You have to open a pull request to the original repo once you feel your code is ready, for your code to be assessed</li>
<li>You are not limited to the set of tools listed on <strong>The prereqs</strong>, you can use any additional tools you feel or know will aid you on your quest</li>
<li>You don't need to complete the whole challenge to create a pull request, if you get stuck at some point, create the pull request and write your issues in the comments</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The challenge</h2>

<p>You will be creating a simple server-client application so common nowadays, using the MEAN stack, the requirements are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>As an individual, 

<ul>
<li>I need a way to create lists of my favorite stuff ( so cliche, right? ) so, several lists of different stuff (books, movies, stores, pizza flavors, whatevs...)</li>
<li>I need a way to add, edit, and delete items on such lists</li>
<li>I need a way to view the lists I create</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer,</p>

<ul>
<li>I need the node_modules to be ignored by git </li>
<li>I need to be able to access the CRUD capabilities of the lists through a RESTful API, json based, from external domains</li>
<li>I need schemas ( mongoose preferred ) for the Lists and Items entities</li>
<li>I need an exposed CRUD API to affect the Lists and Items entities using the correct HTTP verbs for each

<ul>
<li>Create, update, remove, fetch all and fetch by id should be supported for lists and items (10 endpoints total)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I need middleware to happen on each request validating that the user has a cookie named "auth" or not (log the value to output, we are not managing authentication of any kind just yet)</p></li>
<li><p>I need a test suit testing the endpoints </p></li>
<li>I need a test suit testing the middleware covering the cases where the user has a cookie named "auth", a cookie with another name or no cookie at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuff that will be graded</p>

<pre><code>Logic and code complexity   ( How easy will my code be to maintain by someone else? Am I using good practices and/or design patterns? )
Code coverage               ( Is my code tested? Are all scenarios considered? )
Requirement coverage        ( Is the application doing what it is meant to be doing? )
Rule compliance             ( Did i follow the few rules set on **The rules** ? )
